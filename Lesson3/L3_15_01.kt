/*Practice Time
Improve your whatShouldIDoToday() program with the new knowledge from this segment.

Add 3 more situations and activities. For example:
mood == "sad" && weather == "rainy" && temperature == 0 -> "stay in bed" 
temperature > 35 -> "go swimming"
Create a single-expression function for each condition and then use it in your when expression.
Challenge
Instead of passing in the mood, get a mood string from the user.

Hint: The !! operator may come handy.

Loops
This lesson introduced the while and repeat loops. To practice using them, do the following:

Change your fortune cookie program to use repeat() instead of a for loop. What happens to the break instruction? Using the error message from the compiler, with what you've learned so far, can you think of why?
Change your fortune cookie program to use a while loop, which is the better choice when you are looping until a condition is met.*/

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
   println(whatShouldIDoToday("happy", "sunny"))
   println(whatShouldIDoToday("sad"))
   print("How do you feel?")
   println(whatShouldIDoToday(readLine()!!))

 /*
   repeat (10) {
   fortune = getFortune(getBirthday())
   println("\nYour fortune is: $fortune")
   if (fortune.contains("Take it easy")) break;
   }
*/

/*
   while (!fortune.contains("Take it easy")) {
   fortune = getFortune(getBirthday())
   println("\nYour fortune is: $fortune")
   }*/
}

fun isVeryHot (temperature: Int) = temperature > 35

fun isSadRainyCold (mood: String, weather: String, temperature: Int) = mood == "sad" && weather == "rainy" && temperature == 0

fun isHappySunny (mood: String, weather: String) = mood == "happy" && weather == "sunny"

fun whatShouldIDoToday(mood: String, weather: String = "sunny", temperature: Int = 24) : String {
   return when {
      isVeryHot(temperature) -> "go swimming"
      isSadRainyCold(mood, weather, temperature) -> "stay in bed"
      isHappySunny(mood, weather) -> "go for a walk"
      else -> "Stay home and read."
   }
}
