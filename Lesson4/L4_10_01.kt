/*Abstract and Interface
Let's go back to your spices. Make Spice an abstract class, and then create some subclasses that are actual spices.

It's easiest (organizationally) if you make a new package, Spices, with a file, Spice, that has a main() function.
Copy/paste your Spice class code into that new file.
Make Spice abstract.
Create a subclass, Curry. Curry can have varying levels of spiciness, so we don't want to use the default value, but rather pass in the spiciness value.
Spices are processed in different ways before they can be used. Add an abstract method prepareSpice to Spice, and implement it in Curry.
Curry is ground into a powder, so let's call a method grind(). However, grinding is something that's not unique to curry, or even to spices, and it's always done in a grinder. So we can create an Interface, Grinder, that implements the grind() method. Do that now.
Then add the Grinder interface to the Curry class.*/

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
}

abstract class Spice(val name: String, val spiciness: String = "mild", color: SpiceColor) : SpiceColor by color {
    abstract fun prepareSpice()
}
class Curry(name: String, spiciness: String,
            color: SpiceColor = YellowSpiceColor) : Spice(name, spiciness, color), Grinder {
    override fun grind() {
    }

    override fun prepareSpice() {
        grind()
    }
}

interface Grinder {
    fun grind()
}

interface SpiceColor {
    val color: String
}

object YellowSpiceColor : SpiceColor {
    override val color = "Yellow"
}
