/*Practice Time: Basic Operations
If you start with 2 fish, and they breed twice, producing 71 offspring the first time, 
and 233 offspring the second time, and then 13 fish are swallowed by a hungry moray eel, 
how many fish do you have left? How many aquariums do you need if you can put 30 fish per aquarium?*/
