/*
Practice Time
One book is rarely alone, and one author rarely writes just one book.

Create a Set of book titles called allBooks, for example, by William Shakespeare.
Create a Map called library that associates the set of books, allBooks, to the author.
Use the collections function any() on library to see if any of the books are �Hamlet�
Create a MutableMap called moreBooks, and add one title/author to it.
Use getOrPut() to see whether a title is in the map, and if the title is not in the map, add it.*/


fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val allBooks = setOf("Macbeth", "Romeo and Juliet", "Hamlet", "A Midsummer Night's Dream")
    val library = mapOf("Shakespeare" to allBooks)
    println(library.any { it.value.contains("Hamlet") })

    val moreBooks = mutableMapOf<String, String>("Wilhelm Tell" to "Schiller")
    moreBooks.getOrPut("Jungle Book") { "Kipling" }
    moreBooks.getOrPut("Hamlet") { "Shakespeare" }
    println(moreBooks)
}
